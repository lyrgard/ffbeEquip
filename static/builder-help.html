<h4 class="ffbe_text--title mb-4">Why Log In?</h4>

<div class="row">
	<div class="col-5">
		<h6 class="font-weight-bold">To make builds tailored just for your available equipments</h6>

		<ul>
		<li>Log in and go to the Inventory page.</li>
		<li>Take the time to input your inventory, and update it as necessary.</li>
		</ul>

		<h6 class="font-weight-bold">To allow this tool to suggest you TMR to farm</h6>

		<ul>
		<li>Log in and go to the Units page.</li>
		<li>Take the time to input your units, and adjust the available TMRs.</li>
		<li>When building with "Only owned equipments", select "Include TMR of owned units not farmed yet"</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="col-7">
		<h6 class="font-weight-bold">To be able to use your own esper builds and not the default ones</h6>

		<ul>
		<li>Log in and go to the Espers page.</li>
		<li>Take the time to input your esper information.</li>
		<li>Note: The Espers page uses "path finding." This allows you to select objects on the outer-most ring, and claim all objects along that path. For example, Selecting Ifrit's 75% Beast Killer selects a total of 9 objects, starting with Fire, for a total of 370 SP.</li>
		<li>Note: To remove an added object, simply click on it again. Path finding works here as well, allowing entire sets of objects to be removed. For example, Ifrit's Beast killer can be trimmed back to the 50% killer by clicking on the ATK + 100 object that follows the 50% killer.</li>
		</ul>
